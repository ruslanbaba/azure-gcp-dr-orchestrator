# Cucumber BDD Feature Tests for DR Orchestrator

Feature: Disaster Recovery Orchestrator Security and Functionality
  As a security engineer and DevOps engineer
  I want to ensure the DR orchestrator is secure and functional
  So that business continuity is maintained without security vulnerabilities

  Background:
    Given the DR orchestrator environment is initialized
    And all security configurations are in place
    And monitoring systems are active

  @security @critical
  Scenario: No sensitive data is exposed in configuration files
    Given I scan the repository for exposed secrets
    When I check all configuration files
    Then no hardcoded passwords should be found
    And no API keys should be exposed
    And no private keys should be visible
    And all credentials should use environment variables

  @security @critical  
  Scenario: Authentication and authorization are properly configured
    Given the DR orchestrator is running
    When I attempt to access protected endpoints without credentials
    Then access should be denied
    And appropriate error messages should be returned
    And all access attempts should be logged

  @functionality @critical
  Scenario: Database connectivity and failover works correctly
    Given Azure SQL MI is the primary database
    And GCP Cloud SQL is the secondary database
    When Azure region becomes unavailable
    Then traffic should automatically failover to GCP
    And data synchronization should be maintained
    And RTO should be less than 5 minutes

  @functionality @high
  Scenario: Health monitoring detects system issues
    Given all system components are running
    When a critical service fails
    Then alerts should be triggered within 30 seconds
    And appropriate teams should be notified
    And automated recovery should be attempted

  @security @high
  Scenario: Network security policies are enforced
    Given network policies are configured
    When unauthorized traffic is detected
    Then connections should be blocked
    And security events should be logged
    And security team should be alerted

  @performance @medium
  Scenario: System handles expected load
    Given the DR orchestrator is under normal load
    When load increases by 300%
    Then response times should remain under 2 seconds
    And auto-scaling should activate
    And system stability should be maintained

  @compliance @high
  Scenario: Audit logging captures all required events
    Given audit logging is enabled
    When administrative actions are performed
    Then all actions should be logged with timestamps
    And user identities should be recorded
    And logs should be tamper-evident

  @security @medium
  Scenario: SSL/TLS encryption is properly configured
    Given all services are running
    When I check network communications
    Then all traffic should use TLS 1.2 or higher
    And certificates should be valid
    And weak ciphers should be disabled

  @functionality @medium
  Scenario: Backup and recovery procedures work
    Given automated backups are configured
    When a backup restoration is triggered
    Then data should be restored within RPO limits
    And system functionality should be verified
    And backup integrity should be confirmed

  @security @critical
  Scenario: Secrets rotation works without service disruption
    Given secrets are stored in external secret managers
    When secrets are rotated
    Then services should continue operating
    And new secrets should be applied automatically
    And old secrets should be invalidated
